# Case Study Scenarios to discuss

## Scenario 1: Cost Allocation and Tracking
**Situation**: The company needs to track and allocate costs accurately across different Warehouses and Stores. The costs include labor, inventory, transportation, and overhead expenses.

**Task**: Discuss the challenges in accurately tracking and allocating costs in a fulfillment environment. Think about what are important considerations for this, what are previous experiences that you have you could related to this problem and elaborate some questions and considerations

**Questions you may have and considerations:**
[ Accurately tracking and allocating costs in a fulfillment environment can be challenging because costs come from multiple sources like labor, transportation, inventory, and overhead. One important consideration is defining clear cost centers (e.g., per warehouse or per store) and ensuring that every transaction is linked to the correct unit.  From my experience, inconsistencies in data formats or missing identifiers often create reporting issues. Clear ownership of cost data and standardized processes are essential to avoid misallocation and improve transparency. ]

## Scenario 2: Cost Optimization Strategies
**Situation**: The company wants to identify and implement cost optimization strategies for its fulfillment operations. The goal is to reduce overall costs without compromising service quality.

**Task**: Discuss potential cost optimization strategies for fulfillment operations and expected outcomes from that. How would you identify, prioritize and implement these strategies?

**Questions you may have and considerations:**
[ Cost optimization could include improving warehouse utilization, optimizing transportation routes, and automating repetitive processes. I would start by analyzing current cost reports to identify the biggest cost drivers. Then I would prioritize strategies based on impact and implementation effort. ]

## Scenario 3: Integration with Financial Systems
**Situation**: The Cost Control Tool needs to integrate with existing financial systems to ensure accurate and timely cost data. The integration should support real-time data synchronization and reporting.

**Task**: Discuss the importance of integrating the Cost Control Tool with financial systems. What benefits the company would have from that and how would you ensure seamless integration and data synchronization?

**Questions you may have and considerations:**
[ Integrating with financial systems ensures consistent and real-time cost data, which improves reporting accuracy and decision-making. To ensure seamless integration, I would focus on defining clear APIs or data contracts, handling errors properly, and ensuring idempotency to avoid duplicate entries. ]

## Scenario 4: Budgeting and Forecasting
**Situation**: The company needs to develop budgeting and forecasting capabilities for its fulfillment operations. The goal is to predict future costs and allocate resources effectively.

**Task**: Discuss the importance of budgeting and forecasting in fulfillment operations and what would you take into account designing a system to support accurate budgeting and forecasting?

**Questions you may have and considerations:**
[ Budgeting and forecasting are important to anticipate operational costs and allocate resources efficiently. When designing such a system, I would consider historical cost trends, seasonality (e.g., peak sales periods), and warehouse capacity limits. The system should allow comparing actual costs against planned budgets and highlight deviations. ]

## Scenario 5: Cost Control in Warehouse Replacement
**Situation**: The company is planning to replace an existing Warehouse with a new one. The new Warehouse will reuse the Business Unit Code of the old Warehouse. The old Warehouse will be archived, but its cost history must be preserved.

**Task**: Discuss the cost control aspects of replacing a Warehouse. Why is it important to preserve cost history and how this relates to keeping the new Warehouse operation within budget?

**Questions you may have and considerations:**
[ Preserving cost history when replacing a warehouse is important for audit, reporting, and performance comparison. Even if the Business Unit Code is reused, historical financial data must remain traceable to the original warehouse. This ensures transparency and allows evaluating whether the new warehouse operates more efficiently. ]

## Instructions for Candidates
Before starting the case study, read the [BRIEFING.md](BRIEFING.md) to quickly understand the domain, entities, business rules, and other relevant details.

**Analyze the Scenarios**: Carefully analyze each scenario and consider the tasks provided. To make informed decisions about the project's scope and ensure valuable outcomes, what key information would you seek to gather before defining the boundaries of the work? Your goal is to bridge technical aspects with business value, bringing a high level discussion; no need to deep dive.
